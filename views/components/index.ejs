    <h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio! </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer student at Centennial College, always looking to expand my knowledge 
        and skills and never stop learning about the ever changing software landscape. I am committed 
        to work with teams whose goal is to develop reliable and scalable software systems that 
        positively impact society while improving peopleâ€™s lives. Through my work, I want to inspire 
        and empower others, promote a culture of continuous improvement and push the boundaries of what
        is possible in technology.
